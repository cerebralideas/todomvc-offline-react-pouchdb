# "Offline-First" TodoMVC Example

## Progress

- [ ] Feature: Add routing capability
- [ ] Feature: Add edit capability
- [ ] Feature: Add all bulk functionality: complete all, delete completed
- [x] Feature: Add all basic todo functionality: add, complete, delete
- [x] Get the app to rerender when the PouchDB is updated
- [x] Get the TodoMVC app to render todos stored within IndexedDB using PouchDB
- [x] Initialize the application from [this previous TodoMVC application](https://github.com/cerebralideas/todomvc-universal-react-pouchdb)


## Up and Running

1. Install the dependencies found in the `package.json`
2. Compile the TypeScript to JavaScript

  ```
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

3. Open `public/index.html` in your browser.

## What's an "offline-first" application?

Coming soon ...

Here's the full tech-stack that we've chosen to execute this idea:

- **TypeScript**: used for transpiling (JSX and ES6) and module bundling for universal module design
- **React**: the V in MVC
- **Express**: our lightweight, un-opinionated, server framework
- **Page.js**: our client side routing technology
- **PouchDB**: for data storage and future "offline" capabilities

#### A bit on the top 4:

> TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.

> _[TypeScript - typescriptlang.org](http://typescriptlang.org)_

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.
